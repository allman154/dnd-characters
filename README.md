# D&D Interactive Character Card - Work in Progress

A small React practice project that displays interactive Dungeons & Dragons character cards. 
Each card shows key stats (HP, class, weapons, armor, and potions) and allows basic interactions like adjusting health. 
This project is part of my React.js learning journey.

Features

Displays multiple characters with images, class, and stats
Increment / decrement hit points (HP)
Inventory system for weapons, armor, and potions
Built with a D&D theme for practice and fun
Styled with CSS
